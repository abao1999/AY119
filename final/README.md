GNN_Overview is from a pytorch tutorial on graph neural networks
time_series.ipynb is from a tensorflow tutorial on timeseries
classify_embryo_fluorescent_field_CNN.ipynb is a notebook I developed to apply CNN to fluorescent field images of cell embryos to classify polarization state. It includes a lot of knowledge from deep learning modules, plus computer vision concepts I picked up elsewhere.
